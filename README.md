# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ml
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making early 
detection crucial for effective treatment and prevention. Traditional diagnostic 
methods can be time-consuming and may require expensive tests. Machine 
Learning (ML) offers a data-driven approach to predict heart disease risk based 
on medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart 
rate, and lifestyle factors. By analyzing historical patient data, ML models can 
identify patterns and correlations that may not be easily detected by 
traditional methods.
This project focuses on developing a predictive model using ML algorithms like 
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and 
Neural Networks. The goal is to classify patients into risk categories based on 
their health metrics, improving diagnostic accuracy and aiding healthcare 
professionals in decision-making.
The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions. By providing an 
early warning system, this project aims to reduce the risk of severe heart 
complications and promote proactive healthcare management.
